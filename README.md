## Update the Google Maps API key

For local development, create a new `.ts` file at the root level called `DONT_SHOW_THIS.ts` (or another name you set for the script referenced in `index.html`) with the script snippet that Google Maps recommends for dynamically loading in their APIs. See [docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/load-maps-js-api) here.

You'll need to create an account on the Google Maps Platform and an app to get access to an API key to set on this script.

## Setup

```sh
npm i
npm run dev  # development
npm run build  # production
```
